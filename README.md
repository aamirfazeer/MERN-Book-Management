MERN Stack Book Management System

This project is a comprehensive full-stack application for managing a book collection, developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It provides a basic CRUD interface to manage books, demonstrating how to set up both the backend and frontend from scratch. The backend API performs CRUD operations with MongoDB and Express, while the React frontend presents an interactive, responsive user experience.
